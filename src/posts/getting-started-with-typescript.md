# Getting Started with TypeScript and React

TypeScript and React make a powerful combination for building scalable web applications. In this guide, we'll explore how to set up a new project and leverage TypeScript's type safety with React's component model.

## Setting Up Your Project

First, create a new project using Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
```

## Adding Type Safety

TypeScript helps catch errors early:

```typescript
interface Props {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

function Greeting({ name, age }: Props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.</h1>;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always define prop types
2. Use interfaces for complex objects
3. Leverage type inference where possible
